Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.")

ai.respond("For all their extended drones, Sunn O))) have been about change. Soon after recording the heralded Grimm Robe Demos a decade ago, amp-and-volume addicts Stephen O'Malley and Greg Anderson had the good sense to realize that slow, distended riffs-- no matter how quaking, visceral, and charged-- could quickly wear down a band. To that end, Sunn O))) have collaborated with dozens of avant-garde and metal heavyweights over six full-lengths and a bevy of EPs, live takes, and joint releases. From noise paragon Merzbow and ex-Melvins/Earth grinder Joe Preston to contemporary allies Boris and Xasthur necro Malefic, an impressive horde have left their mark on Sunn O)))'s colossal doom.")

ai.respond("Dømkirke-- a vinyl-only, 2xLP set recorded in March 2007 in a 12th century Norwegian cathedral-- showcases Sunn O)))'s malleability and versatility. Here, Anderson and O'Malley are assisted by four auxiliary members: Attila Csihar, the enigmatic vocalist of black metal band Mayhem; Steve Moore, the Southern Lord horns-and-keyboards specialist who now plays in Earth full time; longtime Sunn O))) collaborator Tos Nieuwenhuizen; and Lasse Marhaug, an Oslo electronicist whose work as Jazkamer spun glorious noise from metal threads on 2006's Metal Music Machine. The Borealis Festival-- an artistically adventurous affair spread throughout venues in Bergen, Norway's second city-- commissioned the piece to mirror the gothic Gregorian hymns of the Late Middle Ages... [which] reflected the despair, the terrors and darkness of the world. Oh, the irony and possibilities...")
